# Go 3.0 - Go Forward ðŸš€

Go is at its core a URL shortening service built for the GMU community. It was
the first big SRCT project that was taken from development to production by the
founders. Originally a PHP app, it was translated into Django as a 1.0 release
and sat unmaintained for a period of time. Development on 2.0 started in 2016
with the intention of modernizing the application as well as designing for long
term maintenance. Additionally, since the core of the project is fairly simple,
2.0 functioned as a good introduction to open source development for new
members.

Go 3.0 is currently in production with the goal of modernizing the project with new functionality.

A project of [GMU SRCT](https://srct.gmu.edu).

## Architecture of the project

### `go_ahead` | The react app

`go_ahead` is the react.js frontend of the project. It is built with the React
JavaScript framework to allow for rapid development and experimentation. There
is also a lot of interactivty that the framework allows that we can leverage
for a smooth user experience.

### `go_back` | The django API

`go_back` is the API backend of the project. It is built with the Django REST
Framework (python). It supports all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
operations on Go links as well as account management.

## How to get up and running

As always, the first step is to get the project running on your local machine.

Consult the [docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/) for instructions on how to install Docker CE and the [docker-compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on how to install Docker Compose.

Run:

```sh
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

Navigate to [127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) after the compose process has finished running to access the app.
