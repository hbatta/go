# Go 2

#### A project of [GMU SRCT](https://srct.gmu.edu).

Go is a drop-in URL shortening service. This project aims to provide an easy to use
URL branding service for institutions that wish to widely disseminate information
without unnecessarily outsourcing branding.

Go is currently a `Python 3` project written in the `Django` web framework, with
`MySQL` as our backend database.

# Setup instructions for local development

Go currently supports developers on Linux, macOS and Windows platforms. Please follow the setup instructions for your operating system:
- [Windows](https://github.com/srct/go/wiki/Initial-Setup:-Windows)
- [Mac](https://github.com/srct/go/wiki/Initial-Setup:-Mac)
- [Linux](https://github.com/srct/go/wiki/Initial-Setup:-Linux)


# Some words about contributing to Go.

If this is your first time contributing to a web application written in a framework like Django, it is highly recommended that you complete at least part of the [Official Django Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial01/). This tutorial will teach you how Django projects are organized and will allow you to have a much easier time figuring out what's going on in the Go codebase. If you have any questions about the Django tutorial or Python, feel free to ask in the #go channel in Slack.

## Testing

You are _very strongly_ encouraged to write test cases where applicible for
code that you contribute to the repo. This is not a rule at the moment but rather
a strong suggestion. It's good practice for corporate land and will also ensure
your code works. Additionally, there are quite a few example ones to look at in
the repo and on Google.

### Running Unit Tests

Unit tests are run on every commit sent to gitlab though that can be a pain to
rely on. Here's how to run them locally:

## CONTRIBUTING.md

This document goes into detail about how to contribute to the repo, plus some
opinions about using `git`.

## Opening issues

There is a template for issue descriptions located on the new issue page. I will
close issues with poor descriptions or who do not follow the standard.

## Coding style

You should adhere to the style of the repo code. Consistancy is key! PEP8 guidelines
are strongly reccomended but not enforced at the time. Please comment your code,
I will not accept commits that contain uncommented code.

## Getting Help

I encourage you to join the [#go channel](https://srct.slack.com/messages/go/details/) in SRCT's [Slack Group](https://srct.slack.com)
if you have any questions on setup or would like to contribute.
